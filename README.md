# Personal-Projects

This repository will include personal projects I created whilst studying Game Programming at CG Spectrum.

I am currently studying the Introduction to Game Programming course at CG Spectrum from the 7th of August 2023 until the 7th of November 2023.


I will then be starting the Advanced Game Programming course at CG Spectrum from the 27th of November 2023 until the 27th of August 2024.
